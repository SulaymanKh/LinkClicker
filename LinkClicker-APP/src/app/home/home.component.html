        <h2>About This Application</h2>
        <p>This application features a basic Angular frontend that interacts with an ASP.NET Core Web API. The API supports link creation, deletion, and retrieval, with built-in pagination to handle large datasets efficiently.</p>
        <p>Upon link creation, the backend checks if the database exceeds 200,000 rows. If it does, requests are processed asynchronously using background services. Users receive SignalR notifications upon completion, minimizing the need for extended wait times.</p>
        <p>Pagination is utilized to ensure quick data access and maintain a responsive user experience.</p>
